Priceza Crawler

Design and build a robust crawler that will crawl a page from Priceza and return results about a given keyword.  There are two major queries that will be performed:

Query 1: Total number of results
Given a keyword, such as "iphone", return the total number of results found.  The query for "iphone" should return around 157,091 results.

Query 2: Array of Results
Given a keyword (e.g. "iphone") and page number (e.g. "1"), return the results in a consumable array.  For each result, return the following information:
       Title/Product Name (e.g. "Apple iPhone 4S 32GB")
       Price (e.g. "à¸¿ 3,950.00")
